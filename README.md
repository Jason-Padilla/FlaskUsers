# FlaskUsers
A page dedicated to creating and keeping track of current and new users. When creating a new user the web page validates the information before sending it to the database, if its valid the request will go through and a new user will be added, else it will ask to re-submit the user information. In addition, when creating a new user the webpage will check in real time using AJAX to see if the email being inputed is available. Once a user is created they can be viewed, edited or deleted.
